# Machine Learning Learning Repository

This repository contains my complete Machine Learning learning journey, including theory, math foundations, algorithm implementations, experiments, and applied projects.
Everything here is written, coded, and tested by me while learning ML step by step — this is not a tutorial dump.

The purpose of this repo is to build real ML understanding, not just run notebooks.

Why This Repository Exists

Most people “learn ML” by copying code. I’m doing the opposite.

This repo is my:

Long-term ML knowledge base

Revision system for exams and interviews

Proof of consistent learning and engineering discipline

Foundation for projects, research, and MSc-level work

Learning Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

For every topic, I follow this order:

Understand the math and intuition

Implement the algorithm from scratch

Use libraries only after understanding internals

Visualize results and errors

Apply to real datasets

Write notes + mistakes learned

If something is missing or messy, it means I’m still learning it.

What You’ll Find Here

Python for ML (NumPy, Pandas, plotting)

Math for ML (linear algebra, probability, statistics)

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Supervised learning algorithms

Unsupervised learning algorithms

Model evaluation and validation

Experiments and case studies

End-to-end ML projects

Notes written in my own words

Tools & Stack

Python

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

Git & GitHub

(Deep learning will be added later)

Current Status

This repository is actively updated as I learn new topics.
Commits reflect real progress, not cosmetic changes.

Future Plan

Add deep learning modules

Add ML system design notes

Add project-grade pipelines

Convert this into a portfolio-level ML repo

Use this repo for internships, MSc, and research applications

Final Note

This repo is a long-term game.
No shortcuts. No fake progress. No copied projects.

Consistency is the only ru
